# Quantum project
## Introduction to Qiskit
[Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides) is an open-source framework developed by IBM
for working with quantum computers.
It provides tools to develop quantum algorithms, simulate quantum circuits, and run 
experiments on actual quantum devices.

Qiskit is built on top of Python, making it accessible and easy to use for developers with a
background in Python programming. The framework consists of four main components:

* Qiskit Terra: This is the foundation of the Qiskit framework, providing tools to create quantum circuits,
manage classical and quantum registers, and optimize quantum programs.


* Qiskit Aer: This component includes simulators for testing quantum algorithms without needing access to actual
quantum hardware. It's useful for running quantum circuits locally and simulating large-scale quantum systems.


* Qiskit Ignis: A set of tools for quantum error correction, noise characterization, and quantum system verification.
It helps developers evaluate and improve the performance of quantum circuits on real hardware.


* Qiskit Aqua: This module provides algorithms and applications for quantum machine learning, quantum chemistry,
optimization problems, and more.

With Qiskit, you can design quantum algorithms, simulate their behavior on classical computers,
and eventually run them on quantum processors available on IBM Quantumâ€™s cloud platform, IBM Quantum Experience.

For those new to quantum computing, Qiskit also provides numerous tutorials and resources to help
you get started with building quantum applications.
